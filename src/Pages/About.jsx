<h3 className="sm:ml-[200px]  text-2xl">Introduction</h3>
<p className="sm:w-[600px] w-[350px] font-bold sm:text-1xl  py-2  ">When we started Hoggan Offline Courses back in 2018, our goal was to give Somalis from all across the world the ability to learn the skills they’d need to succeed in this modern century. We set out to create a new, interactive way of learning — making it engaging, flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then, we have helped hundreds of Somali people worldwide unlock modern technical skills and reach their full potential through code. There are two commitments we've made to the world. We've been grounded by these since day one: Increase access <br /> to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere; Enhance <br /> teaching and learning Offline through research</p>
 
    <h1 className="font-bold sm:text-5xl text-4xl  py-3 ">Our Mission</h1>
    <p className="sm:w-[600px] w-[350px] font-bold sm:text-1xl  py-2  ">We want to create a world where anyone can build something meaningful  with technology, and everyone has the learning tools, resources, and opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of possibilities — all that’s required is the curiosity and drive to learn. At Dugsiiye, we are dedicated to empowering all people, regardless of where they are in their coding journeys, to continue to learn, grow, and make an impact on the world around them</p>
